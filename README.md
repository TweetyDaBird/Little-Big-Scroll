## A family of low-cost and easy to build macro pads. 
Usable for Media control, macro buttons, or just about anything else you can imagine and code in QMK.

### The 'family' includes:
- **Little Big Scroll 6** - 6 Cherry MX compatible buttons, one Ø40 mm encoder wheel with button. (Prototype being tested)
- **Little Big Scroll 4** - 2 or 4 Cherry MX compatible buttons, one Ø40 mm encoder wheel with button, optional 128x32px OLED. (Complete and available for sale/manufacturing)
- **Little Big Scroll** - A single Ø40 mm encoder wheel with button. (Design completed, pending prototype)

### Common specifications
- Use a Promicro or equivalent controller
- Programmable with QMK and VIAL
- Cherry MX style keyswitches
- Kaihl hot swap sockets
- Clickable Rotary encoder with up to 40mm wheel
- Designed with a complete sandwich case for an easy build (If purchased, comes as a complete kit)
- Optional Per Key RGB / Encoder Underglow
- (LBS 4) Optional 0.91" 128x32 OLED screen

## Buildguide

### Step-by-step
- Solder hotswap sockets in markings
- Solder capacitors C1, C2 in markings
- **LSB 4 only** - If you are mounting the OLED, solder Resistors R1, R2 & OLED Screen in place
- Solder Encoder
- Solder controller, face up, flush with underside of PCB (*)
- Assemble plate/spacers around the PCB (**)
- Insert switches/caps (remember to support the sockets!) and add encoder wheel
- Program
- Enjoy!

(*) The controller can be socketed, but that adds height, and you need longer spacers than the ones included if purchasing a kit.

(**) For LSB 4, the unused plate forms the bottom, unless a solid backplate is added as an optional extra. Breakaway tabs need to be removed and filed before use.

## Buy a kit!
I sell complete kits, making it easy to build your keyboard, and it also supports prototypes for new wacky ones.
